# PRJ34-bitTorrentToy

A bit torrent toy application

Simple (french) toy implementation of the BitTorrent Protocol

## Current Assumptions

- Bencoding management
	- All read strings are well formed and correct

## Dependencies

- bottle.py (included with repository)

## Personal notes in the event of a compatibility to Python 3.X
- Converter.py will need to take care of the byte strings as Python 3 needs them
